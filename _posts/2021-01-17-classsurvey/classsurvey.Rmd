As I emailed you all last week, we will not have a synchronous class tomorrow but instead have asked you all to **register and attend any sessions of interests** at the **Rstudio global conference** taking place tomorrow The link to register is [here](https://rstudio.com/conference/). 

There are many interesting talks taking place - you can see the full program [here](https://global.rstudio.com/student/catalog). I have earmarked a few talks that are personally interesting to me that I think resonate with topics/issues we will address in the course around using data to make decisions with technology. These are listed below and marked the ones in <span style="color: red;">red</span>  that are specifically on the topic of data visualization, which is a problem we will discuss next week. 

I would pay particular attention to the opening keynote talk by Hadley Wickham (the chief scientist of Rstudio and designer of the *Tidyverse* framework for data science in R, which includes the famed visualization package **ggplot**). 

```{r, out.width=c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold'}

```

```{r, include = FALSE}
schedule <- read_csv("assets/schedule.csv")
schedule <- schedule %>% 
#   mutate(time_est = time_at_tz(time_gmt, tz = "America/New_York")) 
#  mutate(time = format(time_est, "%H:%M")) %>%
  filter(talk_id %in% c(1, 286, 261, 218, 182, 274, 3, 327, 125, 279, 128, 134, 307,222, 323,117,224,  246, 186, 100, 163, 312, 355, 278, 114, 245, 334)) %>%
  mutate(time = lubridate::with_tz(time_gmt, "America/New_York")) %>%
  filter(time < lubridate::make_datetime(2020, 1, 21, 23, 00, tz = "America/New_York")) %>%
  mutate(time = format(time, "%I:%M%p")) %>%
  select(time, name, title_text, url) %>%
  rename(presenter = name, title = title_text)
```


```{r}
knitr::kable(schedule) %>% row_spec(1:7, bold = T, color = "white", background = "red")

```
