The belief in the **law of small numbers** is the belief that the properties of a sample (even a small one) should closely resemble the properties of the population from which the sample is drawn. 

Or said another way, the belief is tied to an **under-estimate** of the role of sampling variation to explain sample outcomes. 


Consider the following judgment task


<font size = 4pt>
Study of the incidence of kidney cancer in 3141 counties in the USA. The counties in which the incidence of kidney cancer is <font color = "red"> lowest </font> are mostly rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican states in the Midwest, the South and the West.
</font>

What do you make of this fact?

## The Mental Shotgun

- This is a thinking problem. 

- System 2 tries to go to work: Searches memory and forms hypotheses. 

- System 1 goes to work also: seeks associative coherence and cognitive ease that it recommends to System 2.

- Associative machine activates network of associates and attempts to assemble story. 

- What is the causal coherence that comes to mind?




## Now consider the following judgment task



<font size = 4pt>
Study of the incidence of kidney cancer in 3141 counties in the USA. The counties in which the incidence of kidney cancer is <font color = "red"> highest </font> are mostly rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican states in the Midwest, the South and the West.
</font>


How can these both be true?


## A Binomial Experiment


Imagine a large urn filled with marbles, half are red and half are white. 

Consider an experiment where we draw four balls, and record the number of red balls. Then we repeat the experiment many times. 

How much more often would we observe the expected outcome of “2 red and 2 blue”  in comparison to the extreme outcome “4 red”. 

Let $X$ be the number of red after $N$ trials. 

Then $X$ is a binomial variable and we can compute $P_{N}(X = x)$ for different values of $N$. 


## A question


Imagine a large urn filled with marbles, half are red and half are white. 

Consider an experiment where we draw four balls, and record the number of red balls. 

Then we repeat the experiment many times. 

How much more often would we observe the expected outcome of “2 red and 2 blue”  in comparison to the extreme outcome “4 red”?



## Another question

Consider Jack who runs a binomial experiment with $N = 4$ and Jill who runs a binomial experiment with $N = 7$.

How much more often does Jill see the extreme outcome of all red as compared to Jack. 

## Key idea


- What does this reveal is the real “cause” of the conflicting new stories on kidney cancer?


- The key factor is not Republican or rural it is sparsely populated.

- Small samples are more likely to yield extreme outcomes – this is a purely statistical phenomena. 

- Yet people treat small samples as representative of the larger sample from which they come (later to be called the “representative heuristic”), and overinterpret the data. 


## Random Sequences

Consider the following sequence of boy and girl births at a hospital. What is their relative likelihood (most likely, etc)

<center>
BBBGGG <br> GGGGGG <br> BGBBGB
</center>


## Causes Trump Statistics

- <font color = red> System 1 </font> is not prone to doubt, suppresses ambiguity, and automatically constructs stories that are coherent. (what alternatives could have happened is the essence of statistical thinking but violates WYSATI)

- The WYSATI produces exaggerated faith in small samples that exaggerates consistency and coherency of the world relative to the actual reliability of the data. 


## But what about the law of large numbers

- System 2 knows the ”law of large numbers”. 

- But does not know it well enough to counteract the swift confidence of System 1. 

- Reprogramming a cognitive illusion can defy even experts
