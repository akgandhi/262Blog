Clean living, no pollution, fresh food without additives

Clean living, no pollution, fresh food without additives. Makes sense – hard for System 2 to refute.


---#3
No access to medical care, high fat diet, alcohol, tobacco Contradicting evidence induced some cognitive strain. Lets relieve it with some help from System 2.


---#4
An accident of sampling. Many facts about the world are due to random chance. System 1 will have a tendency to create strong cognitive ease/coherence and over-infer.

Even with a stats education (and professors of economics and statistics) it takes some mental effort to see the equivalence of the two: Large samples are more precise than small samples Small samples yield extreme results more often than large samples do “The first statement has a clear ring of truth, but until the second version makes intuitive sense, you have not truly understood the first”.

We didn’t really test our theory (there is a priming effect) but rather a “null hypothesis” of no effect? But what does our actual theory/ predict should have happened in the data

We didn’t really test our theory (there is a priming effect) but rather a “null hypothesis” of no effect? But what does our actual theory/ predict should have happened in the data. That is what is missing under a pure Fisherian frame.

Publication bias: what are the real sample of outcomes sitting in the file drawers. What we really would like to have seen is the the same finding (a rejection of the null) to have reproduced were we to run the experiment again?. The real sample in the file drawers under a low powered study will show lots of “failures to reject”.
