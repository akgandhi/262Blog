We will use both synchronous and asynchronous channels for our course interactions.\nWe will meet regularly during our alloted lecture time to engage in one of 3 activities (which will be recorded for those who cannot attend live):\nShort lectures with break-out sessions\nStudent presentations\nVirtual office hours for questions on material\nThe course website will deliver the lectures material extracted from the weekly readings. Our class canvass site will be used to deliver recorded lectures and host asynchronous class discussion.\nWhat is Market Design?\nThe goal of market design is to design policies that improve the efficiency of economic decisions. An economic decision is any decision that involves trade-offs, which is synonymous with the very definition of economics as “the study of the allocation of scarce means to satisfy competing ends.” (Becker 2017)\nEconomic decisions are made by diverse actors in an economic system - households, firms, governments, and even the markets themselves (e.g., the invisible hand!).\nAn economic decision is efficient if it makes an optimal trade-off given the objectives and constraints of the decision maker.\nHelping make decisions more efficient creates value, generates profits, and raises welfare. But how should such interventions be designed? This is the central problem of market design.\nWhat is the Topic of Our Class?\nOur class is focused on the problems of market design in digital environments.\nHumans are increasingly making decisions in the presence of screens and devices, both at work and home. This has been especially pronounced during the last year of the pandemic where life quite literally moved online!\n\nA digital environment is one where computers and devices are networked together to facilitate human communication and transactions.\nWhat is the impact of digital environments on economic decisions? Does the transition from offline to digital environment improve economic efficiency? Can digital environments be designed to enable humans to better optimize their economic decisions?\nThese are central questions for market design in digital environments.\nA key difference between digital decisions and their offline counterparts is the role of data. A digital decision can leverage unprecedented velocity, variety, and volume  of data. The proliferation of data is a product of technological advancements in data science, data engineering, data analytics, machine learning, and A.I, which are distributed to decision makers through public cloud infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA fundamental question is then:\n\nMore Data = Better Decisions?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer is not as straightforward as it may seem. From a purely statistical or econometric viewpoint - more data is always better - we get better parameter inferences, better predictive accuracy, and better power to test models.\nHowever from a decision making perspective matters are less clear. The main problem is that data and A.I. - despite the hype - is not a panacea by itself. The technologies alone do not magically transform decisions. As economists are fond of saying, there is no free lunch!\nHal Varian (Chief Economist at Google and Professor at Berkeley) summarized the matter nicely in a recent interview:\n\nI think there’s a mystical belief in the power of data. Data is like oil in one respect… namely, it needs to be refined in order to be useful. So the data itself is not the important components, the know-how to refine it into something that’s useful. It’s the same [when] we talk about oil or data – it’s just the raw material, it’s not the finished product.\n\nIn order to create value, data technologies need to be transformed into applications that solve real problems and improve economic decisions. That is, applications need to be designed to extract value from data. Without good design, we are left with an alternative possibility:\n\nMore Data =  More Complexity =  Worse Decisions!\n\nA  central problem  for market design is  designing digital environment to translate “more data” into “better economic decisions”..\nWhat is our approach to the topic?\nHow should digital environment be designed to enable efficient economic decisions?\nThe first rule of good design is to know your audience. For whom are we designing? Who is the user?\nLet me state the obvious answer which nevertheless has some profound implications for market design. The user is a human being!\nOur approach in the class is to start with the user - the human - and understand how humans process and act upon data for economic decision making.\nThe interface between a human decision and the raw data in a digital environment is typically defined by a web application. The application processes, models, summarizes, and displays features of the raw data to the user.\n\nThus from a user perspective, effective design in digital environments requires that a market designer to do 3 things:\n1. Identify an existing inefficiency in a human decision making process.\n2. Improve the the decision by leveraging data, technology, and economics.\n3. Influence humans to change their behavior toward the efficient outcome through digital interfaces.\n\nWe can see that success in a market design project involves holistic thinking that integrates data/economic techniques with the visual elements of the digital interface, which are all tailored to the user behaviors we aim to effectuate.\nThis is hard! It is a domain that is still in its infancy and being developed in real time across academic, business, and government as organizations digitally transform make data more central to their operation. It is thus a course that (by design 😄) will aim to pose many more questions than necessarily answering them.\nHow Does this Differ from Data Science?\nWhereas a data science or machine learning classes will often focus attention on elements (2) (usually substituting “better decisions” with “better predictions”) and the plethora of skills and technique involved therein, we will examine the design problem through the human touch points in (1) and (3). Our focus is thus the human-centric design of data technologies to enhance economic decisions.\n\nI recognize that combining “human-centric” and “economic” together is not often how the “dismal science” is practiced or perceived. 😄\nThe science we will apply to the question follows from the seminal work of Kahneman and Tversy (KT for short) who in 1971 began the first inquiry into the question of whether humans naturally are intuitive statisticians - e.g., do humans instinctively process data in a fashion that abides by formal statistical principles?\n\nThe surprising answer to the question was “no”, and led to an influential research paradigm known as “Heuristics and Biases” (H&B for short).\nThe crux of H&B, which is among the biggest discovery in the social and behavioral sciences of the last 50 years, is that there are robust patterns of human cognition that make humans, e.g, Homo Sapien behave differently than the rational ideal, e.g., Homo Economicus. The program spawned the field of behavioral economics and led to Kahneman being awarded the Nobel Prize for Economic Science in 2002 (Tversy sadly passed away in 1996).\nHomo Economicus is the \"rational actor&quot from your principles of economics courses used to model decisions by consumers, firms, and societies/governments.\nCourse Books\nThinking Fast and Slow\n\nOur primary text for the class - “Thinking Fast and Slow” by Daniel Kahneman - describes the conceptual and historical backdrop behind H&B and provides the basic clues for where we can anticipate that sub-rational economic decisions will happen. Identifying these scenarios is a central part of being a market designer in the digital age - data and AI when properly employed should ameliorate these biases and improve economic efficiency.\nNudge\n\nIdentifying an inefficiency in an economic decision is one thing. Changing someone’s behavior towards a more efficient state is quite another. No one likes to be told what to do, especially from data they may not fully be aware or understand.\nPerhaps the answer lies not in directing the outcome of the decision, but rather to nudge the decision maker towards the rational outcome while respecting their autonomy over the decision.\nThis is the key idea behind the book Nudge by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein. Richard Thaler is a behavioral economist who developed the first economic applications of Kahneman and Tversky’s discoveries. He was awarded the Nobel prize himself in 2017.\nAn implication of H&B for market design is that it is not simply what data is presented to humans, but how they are presented that affects which economic decisions are made. It implies that both the presentation of information as well as the information itself are part of the design problem. Said another way - The interface matters!\nNudge applies this fact and recognizes that interfaces (what they call choice contexts) can manipulated and hence designed to produce decisions that are more rational. Thaler and Sunstein call this type of market design choice architecture - designing the choice environment to nudge people to behave more rationally without having to make people “think” more rationally!\nHowever the practice of designing nudges has a potential dark side - especially in digital environments. They can be used to exploit human frailties to extract profits in a way that may not be human welfare improving to the user. Of course the definition of welfare itself can be in the eye of the beholder, and the dividing line between good vs evil nudges is not always clear. We will aim to be mindful of this important complexity as we explore the topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives and Course Evaluation\nThere are 3 primary learning objectives in the class that set the dimensions we use for evaluation and grading.\nReading (35%)\nObjective\nUnderstand the meaning of “Heuristics and Biases” - how are economic decisions made intuitively what are the practical opportunities for market design to nudge decisions to a more efficient state.\nKey Results\nRead the assigned papers and book chapters according to course schedule and engage with readings both through class discussion and the Perusal platform.\nDescription\nThe primary learning experience in the course is rooted in reading the assigned book chapters and papers, and discussing them as a class. We will add a technological twist to this age old formula by adopting the  Perusall  application.\nPerusall manages your engagement in the weekly readings. Perusall itself is based on an intelligent data technology that is aiding a key form of decision making in the classroom - student evaluations! Perusall measures engagement by your annotations in the reading, which forces you into an active reading mode through similar social forces that motivate our online media habits - it thus also embodies key features of Nudge!\nWe will use Perusall to manage the readings from “Thinking Fast and Slow” - which should be purchased through Perusall site. We will also use well as the articles from journals and online sources.\nClass Presentation (25%)\nLearning Objective\nTranslate the insights from the classical H&B science to a modern topic about human decisions in digital settings.\nKey Results\nClass presentation on a research paper assigned from literature that covers the “five main questions” to structure a summary of piece of research.\nDescription\nBoth “Thinking Fast and Slow” and “Nudge” were written before data science came of age. In fact the term “data science” itself was coined in 2008 (by D.J. Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher), the same year as Nudge was published.\n\nData science is in many ways represents the modern day choice architecture. Data scientist are processing, filtering, and designing displays of information that defines the context for a large variety of our economic decisions.\nYou will work in groups of 3 and present one paper associated to one of the cognitive “heuristics and biases” we discuss. The schedule of topics and list of potential papers are listed below.\nI have chosen the papers rather intentionally to provide a current perspective on these classical challenges for economic decision making. Many of the papers are explicitly focused on the way in which heuristics and biases manifest themselves in digital environments where human attention is spent digesting data on a screen.\nThat said, if you have an alternative paper or topic you would rather examine, I am happy to discuss the possibility with you depending on how it fits into the syllabus.\nThe presentation should be roughly 15-20 mins - presented using any medium you prefer (powerpoint, google docs, latex, r markdwon etc) and should address the following issues in order:\n\nWhat is the question that the paper addresses?\nHow is this question related to the ideas of our class?\nHow do they go about studying this question?\nWhat are the primary and secondary findings?\nWhat are the key consequences in your opinion of the research for our understanding for market design and economic decisions in digital environments.\n\nFinal Project (40%)\nObjective\nBuild a digital interface for influencing decision makers through literate programming.\nKey Result\nGroups complete their final project on a blog post that utilizes literate programming techniques and deployed live on the class blog.\nDescription\nLiterate programming is based on a text as code for influencing where code, text, and visuals are part of a single notebook that packages data and storytelling together in one medium.\nYour final project builds on your class presentation. You will be asked to use the paper you studied for your presentation as the basis for a blog post that introduces the topic of the paper to a wider audience, bundles it with additional research/investigation into the topic, and argues why they should care for their economic decision making.\nThe blog post should be written using R markdown and can avail itself of interactive media (visualizations, animations etc) to bring the idea to life.\nWe will assemble all the blog entries from the class and publish a live course blog aimed at practicing data scientist looknig to make an economic impact with their work.\nI will work with each group on their blog concept over the course of the semester.\nCourse Schedule\nWe reference\n“Thinking Fast and Slow” (Kahneman 2011) = tfs\n“Nudge” (Thaler and Sunstein 2009) = nudge\nPapers that are assigned for group presentations are color coded according to:\n\n\nGroup A\n\nor\n\nGroup B\n\n\ndepending on the number of group presentations scheduled.\nWeek 01, 01/18 - 01/22\nThurs Jan 21\nTopic: Rstudio Global Conference\nRegister and attend any session(s) of the Rstudio global conference \nWeek 02, 01/25 - 01/29\nTues Jan 26\nTopic: Syllabus Day\n\n📜 Bounthavong, M.
