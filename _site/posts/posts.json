I have earmarked a few talks that are personally interesting to me that I think resonate with topics/issues we will address in the course around using data to make decisions with technology. These are listed below and marked the ones in red that are specifically on the topic of data visualization, which is a problem we will discuss next week.\nI would pay particular attention to the opening keynote talk by Hadley Wickham (the chief scientist of Rstudio and designer of the Tidyverse framework for data science in R, which includes the famed visualization package ggplot).\n\n\n\n\n\ntime\n\n\npresenter\n\n\ntitle\n\n\nurl\n\n\n11:00AM\n\n\nHadley Wickham\n\n\nMaintaining the house the tidyverse built\n\n\nhttps://global.rstudio.com/student/page/40521\n\n\n01:00PM\n\n\nKara Woo\n\n\nAlways look on the bright side of plots\n\n\nhttps://global.rstudio.com/student/page/40618\n\n\n02:19PM\n\n\nMegan Beckett\n\n\nAesthetically automated figure production\n\n\nhttps://global.rstudio.com/student/page/40627\n\n\n01:19PM\n\n\nSean Lopp\n\n\nR & Python: Going Steady\n\n\nhttps://global.rstudio.com/student/page/40638\n\n\n01:19PM\n\n\nNicole Kramer\n\n\nA New Paradigm for Multifigure, Coordinate-Based Plotting in R\n\n\nhttps://global.rstudio.com/student/page/40633\n\n\n02:00PM\n\n\nSophie Beiers\n\n\nTrial and Error in Data Viz at the ACLU\n\n\nhttps://global.rstudio.com/student/page/40642\n\n\n03:00PM\n\n\nJohn Burn-Murdoch\n\n\nReporting on and visualising the pandemic\n\n\nhttps://global.rstudio.com/student/page/40615\n\n\n06:20PM\n\n\nRiva Quiroga\n\n\nHow to do things with words: learning to program in R with a “communicative approach”\n\n\nhttps://global.rstudio.com/student/page/40637\n\n\n05:00PM\n\n\nEmily Riederer\n\n\noRganization: How to make internal R packages part of your team\n\n\nhttps://global.rstudio.com/student/page/40607\n\n\n05:19PM\n\n\nMalcolm Barrett\n\n\nYou’re Already Ready: Zen and the Art of R Package Development\n\n\nhttps://global.rstudio.com/student/page/40621\n\n\n06:20PM\n\n\nAthanasia M.
