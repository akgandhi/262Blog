Market design is the part of economics that aims to make economics functional - apply economic principles to make real world decisions. We believe modern deployments of economics into the real world invariably involve the confluence of economic principles, data, and technology.\nThe course blog is a reflection of this philosophy. Rather than passively learn through lecture, HW, and exam, we will aim to build economic knowledge into human usable forms.\nOur ultimate aim of which is empowering a new generation of software that is able to “think like an economist” and help humans and organizations make better decisions.\n\n\n\n",
